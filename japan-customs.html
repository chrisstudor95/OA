            <h3>9 Japanese Customs You Should Be Aware Of</h3>

            <h4>1. In Japan, They Will Talk While You Talk</h4>

            <p>You’ll find many people interject or express agreement a lot while you’re talking. This isn’t to be rude — it’s the opposite.
               You’ll get a lot of うんうんうん (un, un un, “yeah, yeah yeah”) and そう (sou, “I see”) while you’re talking to show they’repaying attention.
            </p>

            <h4>2. Riding the Bullet Train in Japan</h4>

            <p>Any time you hop on the bullet train, subway, or other public transportation, expect to get a gentle shove.
               The stations are overcrowded, so people will push and shove a bit to get where they need to go. Even the workers may gently
               push people into the train cars to fit more people.
            </p>

            <h4>3. Splitting the Bill — It’s All Equal</h4>

            <p>Called 割り勘 (warikan), it’s typical to split the bill equally among everyone at the table, no matter where you go or how 
               much you ordered.
            </p>

            <h4>4. In Japanese, There is No Equivalent to “God Bless You” When You Sneeze
            </h4>

            <p>If you or someone else sneezes, there’s no phrase to acknowledge it. It’s actually a bit rude to do so. If you feel like you 
               have to say something, you can say すみません (sumimasen, “excuse me”).
            </p>

            <h4>5. Holidays are Celebrated Differently in Japanese Culture
            </h4>

            <p>While Christmas is typically the biggest day of the year in the West, it’s a romantic date night in Japan! On Valentine’s Day,
               the girls give chocolates to boys they like. And on White Day, March 14th, the boys reciprocate.The biggest holiday of the year,
               though, is New Year’s. There are many traditions around food, cleaning the house, and bringing in luck for the New Year.
            </p>

            <h4>6. No Tipping!
            </h4>

            <p>You don’t tip in Japan for any service. If you leave money, they’ll be confused and think you forgot it!
            </p>

            <h4>7. There are No Trash Cans</h4>

            <p>You won’t find many trash cans while walking around. Despite that, Japan stays relatively litter-free.
               People end up carrying their trash around with them until they get home to properly dispose or recycle it.
            </p>

            <h4>8. Always Bring Back Omiyage
            </h4>

              <p>お土産 (omiyage) is the Japanese word for “souvenirs”. In Japan, you’ll always bring back tiny gifts for your friends,
                 family, and co-workers when you go on a trip. Even if you only traveled a few hours away, it’s polite to bring back
                 a small omiyage, like a good luck charm from a temple or chocolate.
              </p>

              <h4>9. When You Receive a Gift, You’re Supposed to Give One Back
              </h4>

                <p>If you receive a gift in Japan, even if it’s a birthday gift or for a wedding or baby shower, you’re supposed to give a
                   gift back that’s equal to about 50% of the value of what you received. It’s also not unusual to receive a larger gift
                   than you might in the West because it’s expected they’ll get half back. These gifts are call お返し (okaeshi).
