<h2>French culture</h2>
<img  class="images" src="france-history.jpg">
<p>The concept of French Culture poses specific difficulties and presupposes a series of assumptions about precisely what the expression 'French' means. France is the result of centuries of nation-building and the acquisition and incorporation of several historical provinces and overseas colonies into its geographical and political structure. Today, the country is a nation of numerous foreign languages, multiple ethnicities and religions. Many regions all evolved with their own specific cultural and linguistic traditions in fashion, religious observance, regional language and accent, family structure, cuisine, and leisure activities enriched by its unique skills and habits. </p>
<p>French culture is a mixture of many nationalities and customs called multiculturalism. Without denying each culture's particularities, French culture has evolved and transformed itself by uniting these unique cultures. Moreover, the blending of native French and newcomers creates a vibrant and proud French culture and is apparent in popular music, movies and literature. Therefore, there is also a cultural blending (métissage culturel) present in France alongside the mixing of populations. It may be compared to the traditional US conception of the 'melting-pot.' </p>
<h3>"L'art De Vivre À La Française" - French Way Of Life  </h3>
<img class="images" src="france-vivre.jpg">
<h4>Time and enjoyment </h4>
<p>French culture is based on living in the present and living well. The culture involves taking the time necessary - and maybe a little more - to enjoy moments. Eating good dishes and drinking good wine is an excellent example as the French love the experience that goes along with it: sharing and connecting with friends and family. With five weeks of paid vacation, plus every Catholic holiday ever invented, the French are known to be experts at living well. </p>
<p>For most French people, work is a way to gain money to spend on much more exciting activities during free time, like raising children, tasting new meals, or travelling despite being productive and committed while at work, very few French consider it a priority. Many see it more as a constraint or burden preventing them from what they love. In France, the law mandates that stores be closed on Sundays, even though some flexibility is gradually introduced. It is clear evidence that work is not placed above everything else. Sundays are typically days reserved for families with no shopping, sports or other activities. The French will go to the market to buy fresh vegetables, meet friends and neighbours, have a coffee in a little café and take the time to take the (slow) beat of the place they live in. </p>
<h4>Romance, literature, and history </h4>
<p>In the collective imagination, French is the language of love. French poetry, art, films and songs (Chansons françaises) all speak about romance or passion, longing and desire. It is true; the French embody romance and passion! Famous French artists, such as Edith  Piaf, Serge Gainsbourg, Jeanne Moreau, Yves Montand, Françoise Hardy and more recent singer Carla Bruni have an impressive musical repertoire of powerful songs about love. Give them a listen on Best of France's Spotify playlists! Also, among the French words used in English, some come from the lexical field of love and charm, such as « femme fatale », « décolleté », « coup de foudre », « billet doux », « fiancée ». Moreover, the art of togetherness permeates the streets and is a healthy expression of love, and for that reason, all intimacy is considered beautiful. </p>
<p>Books such as Ernest Hemmingway's A moveable feast paint a picture of Paris as a profound and romantic experience, which may explain why people worldwide fall in love with Paris. If you are taking a trip to Paris soon, you should stop at Saint-Germain-des-Prés and the famous Café de Flore, famous existentialist writers, such as Jean-Paul Sartre, used to frequent. </p>
<p>French literature has a long and rich reputation throughout the world. Many philosophers and writers from France have left a lasting legacy in literature such as François Rabelais, Michel de Montaigne, René Descartes, Victor Hugo, Pierre de Ronsard, Molière, Voltaire, François-René de Chateaubriand. Victor Hugo's Les Misérables is celebrated as one of the best novels of the 19th century. Hugo wrote it with the intent to encourage social reform and confront inequality in European republics. The book addresses French concerns for social welfare, but it establishes an origin for the staunch national pride France is credited with today. </p>
<h3>French cuisine</h3>
<img class="images" src="france-cuisine.jpg">
<p>Gastronomy is inseparable from the French way of life. French Cuisine is distinguished by its refinement and creativity and excellence in specific sectors such as pastry. This culture of eating well is a customary social practice for everyone and not just for the elite. It is not so much the plate's content as the importance of the meal and the friendliness. </p>
<p>In France, the meal is a moment that requires attention and time. Welcoming guests, purchasing the right, preferably local products whose favours o well together; the pairing of food with wine; the setting of a beautiful table; and specific actions during consumption, such as smelling and tasting items at the table, are all priorities for the vast majority of French people. </p>
<h4>Eat-in courses </h4>
<p>In France, the meal should respect a fixed structure, commencing with an apéritif (drinks before the dinner) and ending with liqueurs, containing in between at least four successive courses, namely a starter, fish or meat with vegetables, cheese and dessert. UNESCO even added the traditional French multi-course meal to its Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Prendre l'apéro (having an apéritif) before dinner, similar to 'Happy Hour' in Canada, is also popular. The aperitif is synonymous with conviviality. It is a light snack made up of peanuts, sausage, olives, and other tapas is a pretext for a drink, such as Pastis, Porto, Clairette, Rosé or beer, and to whet the appetite. </p>
<p>Moreover, the French stick to a regular meal schedule: a light breakfast in the morning, lunch at noon, le goûter (a sweet snack that the French enjoy around 4 p.m. and 4:30 p.m., just after shortbread, and dinner in the evening. French eat sweets in the morning. No bacon or eggs; everything revolves around pastries: croissant, pain au chocolat (chocolate croissant), pain aux raisins, and butter-jam bread. A walk to the nearest bakery to buy freshly baked pastries is a daily habit. </p>
<p>Each region has a distinctive cuisine based on local, fresh and seasonal ingredients and its specialties and styles. For example, Normandy's farmlands and Atlantic coast produce dishes featuring seafood, apples, and dairy products, such as butter, cream, and cheese. In Burgundy, Boeuf Bourguignon (cubed beef cooked in red wine) is a well-known classic. The south of France's Provence favours using olive oil over butter, and traditional dishes often include fresh tomatoes, garlic, and herbs such as basil, rosemary and oregano. Alsace, near Germany's border, tends to feature hearty meat dishes, like Choucroute and other German-influenced foods.

  <h2>French traditions</h2>
  <h3>Traditions for Baby's Arrival </h3>
  <img src="france-baby.jpg" class="images">
  <p>Baby showers aren't common in France, but expectant mothers are often showered with practical, nearly new items from friends and family after the baby's birth. Unsurprisingly, French tradition involves wine, even for a new arrival. The ultimate gift is a case of wine representing baby's year of birth that the parents can lay down to mature until the child reaches adulthood at age 21. </p>
  <p>For the new mother, an old French tradition is for the new father to present a diamond piece of jewelry to celebrate the birth of the couple's child, especially in the case of the first born child. </p>
  <h3>Birthday Traditions </h3>
  <img src="france-birthday.jpg" class="images">
  <p>Attend a birthday party in France and you'll notice quite a few similarities, plus a few differences, to birthday celebrations you've experienced in the US. Expect cake adorned with fruit instead of icing. Learn how to sing "Joyeux anniversaire!" and if you don't know what to choose for a gift, go with flowers or anything that's elegantly wrapped and tastefully adorned with ribbon. </p>
  <h3>Wedding Traditions </h3>
  <img src="france-wedding.jpg" class="images">
  <p>At French weddings, it is traditional for someone to behead bottles of real Champagne using a specially made saber. According to legend, the tradition originated with Napoleon's skilled Hussard horse soldiers. In victory, they would ride up at a full gallop and cleanly chop the top of champagne bottles held aloft by ladies. Since the early 19th century, a traditional French wedding cake, called croquembouche, is a towering confection made of pastries or macarons piled into a cone and bound with spun sugar or threads of caramel. </p>
