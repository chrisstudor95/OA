                <h3>4 Facts of Modern Japanese Culture that Everyone Should Know About</h3>

                <h4>1. Capsule Hotels</h4>

                <p>Also called pod hotels, this style of hotel became popular in Japan as cheap overnight rooms for salarymen
                   (office workers) who work long hours. These capsule rooms usually consist of just a bed, air conditioning, outlets,
                   and a TV. The room is the size of a bed, and only tall enough to sit up in, so you have to crawl inside.
                   They have communal bathrooms and showers, as well as a locker area to store your things.
                </p>

                <h4>2. Japanese Bathroom Etiquette
                </h4>

                <p>You may expect the bathroom to be the same in Japan, but be warned — it’s a wild ride! In cities, you’ll
                   find a Western-style toilet, but with all kinds of extra features. They often have a bidet, heated seats,
                   and even a wash-and-dry feature. The toilet may even talk to you or make noise! Some toilets have what’s
                   called an Otohime, or “sound princess,” to mask any unpleasant noises.In rural areas, though, they have
                   a traditional Japanese toilet that’s more or less a hole in the ground that you have to squat over it.
                   When at someone’s home, you’ll find a pair of bathroom slippers to use only in the bathroom and then remove
                   upon exit. Like taking your shoes off when you enter the home, the same is true here. The bathroom is a separate
                   “dirty” space and needs its own shoes.Plus, traditional Japanese bathtubs are heavenly.
                   They’re much larger and deeper than Western-style tubs, making them more comfortable to soak in.
                   You’ll find a showerhead and stool where you’ll wash and rinse off first, and then hop in the tub.
                   The reason is that most Japanese people fill the tub once, and then everyone uses the same water after them until
                   everyone has finished bathing for the day. So you want to keep the water clean!
                </p>

                <h4>3. Harajuku and Japanese Street Fashion
                </h4>

                <p>Japanese street fashion is a huge topic all on its own. Harajuku is the main fashion hub in Tokyo,
                   where you’ll see all kinds of haute couture. From lolita gothic style to the gyaru-style of overly tan and heavy makeup,
                   you’ll see a lot of amazing outfits like you’re at New York Fashion Week. If you’re into fashion,
                   Harajuku is the place to go. Some styles are a bit softer or more traditional, like mori kei or modern kimono style,
                   but many people come to show off their looks.
                </p>
                <h4>
                  4. Japanese Anime, Manga, and Video Games
                </h4>

                <p>
                  Japanese animation, comics, and video games are widely popular upon all age groups in Japan.
                  There are four main categories of topics that tend to show up over and over again: mecha, yokai,kawaii,
                  and apocalyptic. These categories are deeply ingrained in Japanese culture.Mecha, or robots, signify Japan’s constant
                  technological innovation. Yokai, or ghosts and demons, are often based on Japanese folklore and fascination with the
                  supernatural, stemming from Shino beliefs. Kawaii or “cute” culture is very prevalent in all aspects of Japanese life.
                  From brand mascots to J-Pop stars, everything must be cute and perceived as or invoking a sense of innocence.
                  This, in part, stems from the last category: apocalyptic.Japan suffered a lot of pain and saw unthinkable horrors 
                  following the atomic bombs during WWII; they’re the only country to have lived through a nuclear weapon.
                  Many Japanese people still have memories or connections to this by watching the suffering of family members or
                  witnessing how it shaped their country moving forward. Because of that, an obsession with apocalyptic depictions
                  in art came about as a way to work through that pain and even as an example of hope and perseverance.
                  It’s also why an emphasis is placed on maintaining innocence because that was lost for many following the end
                  of the war.So while anime, manga, and video games are often light-hearted, the popular categories and features
                  in them are deep-rooted in Japanese culture and history.
