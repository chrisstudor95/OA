                <h3>5 Aspects of Traditional Japanese Culture to Be Aware Of
                </h3>

                <h4>1. Geisha</h4>

                <p>Geisha are one of the most beautiful aspects of Japanese culture. But many people have negative impressions about what
                   being a “geisha” entails. Geisha are not prostitutes, but performers and entertainers. They often perform as hosts and 
                   guides into the world of traditional Japanese art and music. A geisha will dance, sing, and play the shamisen 
                   (the string instrument most people associate with traditional Japanese music). She may also write kanji in traditional
                   calligraphy. They can still be found performing today, mostly in Kyoto.
                </p>

                <h4>2. Samurai, Ninja, Shogun and Emperor
                </h4>

                <p>In feudal Japan, samurai were the warriors that rose to power and started the shogunate. Lead by the shogun,
                   they took power away from the emperor until the Meiji Restoration in 1868. The samurai code of honor is called
                   the bushido, “the way of the warrior,” and many samurai were wealthy lords, known as daimyo. A samurai’s honor
                   came from his sword, and even as late as World War II, soldiers would make banzai attacks with samurai swords.Ninja,
                   also called shinobi, were the Japanese assassins, spies, or disgraced samurai. They were often pitted against samurai
                   lords in feudal Japan and developed their art of stealthy fighting known as ninjutsu. Ninja continued to fight in
                   wars or serve as spies until the Edo Period.The shogun led Japan for many years, until the fall of Tokugawa.
                   During the Meiji Restoration, power was given back to the Emperor, and emphasis shifted from bushido to
                   State-sponsored Shinto which revered the emperor as a descendant of the Sun God, Amaterasu. This lasted until
                   Japan lost World War II, and lead to modern Japan with power resting in the Prime Minister.With each new emperor
                   comes a new “era.” Japan celebrates each change in era, as they recently did when Emperor Akihito abdicated.
                   This ended the Heisei era, and his son, Emperor Naruhito, started the Reiwa era.

                <h4>3. Kimono and Traditional Japanese Clothing
                </h4>

                <p>Kimono is an intricate piece of clothing, made up of several layers and an obi, or sash. And yukata,
                   are the light-weight kimono-like garments worn to matsuri or “festivals” during the summer. Hakama is traditional men’s 
                   garb, that features a pleated skirt and obi. If you’ve ever seen Ruroni Kenshin, he wears a style of hakama.
                    Zouri are the wooden sandals you often see worn with traditional Japanese clothing.There’s also jinbei,
                   a lightweight summer outfit that you can wear to bed, as housewear, or instead of yukata at festivals.
                   They look similar to a yukata in style but are made up of a short-sleeve shirt and shorts. They’re usually worn by men,
                   boys, and babies, but women can wear them, too.
                </p>

                <h4>4. Onsen</h4>

                <p>Onsen are hot springs in Japan. There’s many onsen due to the active volcanic activity,
                   and they’re often outside or at ryokan (a traditional Japanese inn or bed and breakfast).
                   You have to wash up before entering the onsen. Swimwear, clothing, or towels in the onsen are considered “dirty.”
                   And many onsen don’t allow anyone with tattoos. (For many years, only the Japanese mafia, called the Yakuza,
                   had tattoos.) This is changing, though, and tattoo-friendly onsen exist.
                </p>

                <h4>5. Religion in Japan: Shinto, Buddhism, Christianity,
                </h4>

                <p>Shinto is the primary, native religion in Japan, although many people follow Buddhism as well.
                   Shintoism is a belief that godliness, or 神 (kami), exists all around us in life-giving things. For example,
                   water has kami, because water is necessary for life. Most of the traditional shrines you see in Japan and in
                   anime are Shinto shrines.Buddhism is also practiced in Japan, and most people considering themselves Buddhist.
                   Japan had a brief period of time where Christian missionaries from Portugal came to spread the faith, but today,
                   only about 3% of Japanese people consider themselves to be Christian.Even though religion exists in Japan,
                   the Japanese tend to follow more of a moral code and etiquette than religious practices. But they do have many
                   Shinto and Buddhist-based traditions surrounding death, family, and ancestors. For instance, many people keep
                   a small shrine inside their home to honor deceased family members.Death still has quite a stigma in Japan.
                   4 and 9 are unlucky numbers because they sound like the words for “death” and “agony.” Many buildings
                  (especially hospitals) will not have a 4th or 9th floor because of this. And morticians are often
                  looked down upon as “dirty” and “unclean” for working with the deceased, even though they follow a beautiful
                  ritual to honor the dead upon passing. The critically acclaimed Japanese movie “Departures” is about this topic.
