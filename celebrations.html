           <p>When it comes to festivals, the Japanese know how to celebrate.
             Their traditional ‘matsuri’ may have started hundreds of years ago and they may vary from community to community,

               to join in the fun. In fact, it’s said that you’ll always find a festival going on somewhere in Japan. Here are 12 of
                the most popular celebrations and festivals in the Japanese calendar to whet your appetite.

             People gather at the temples at midnight on the 31st of December to ring out the old year on giant bronze bells,
              before they say prayers to bring them luck and success in the New Year. It’s possibly the most important holiday in Japan,
